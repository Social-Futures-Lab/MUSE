[POST_CONTENT]

Given a tweet, you are required to generate three different queries from the tweet for the Google Search Engine to get the most relevant web content to fact-check the tweet. Your answer should follow the following format:

1. QUERY_1
2. QUERY_2
3. QUERY_3
Where QUERY_1, QUERY_2, and QUERY_3 represent query text without quotation marks.

If the given tweet is not informative enough to generate a query, you should answer "NONE".
