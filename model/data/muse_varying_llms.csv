https://www.reuters.com/legal/will-twitter-layoffs-violate-us-law-2022-11-04/","This tweet is misleading. While it's true that Twitter has significantly reduced its workforce, the number of employees is not as low as 1,300. As of January 11, 2023, Twitter had laid off about 200 employees, which was about 10% of its workforce, after terminating about 3,700 people in November 2022. This suggests that the number of employees is higher than the 1,300 stated in the tweet. The layoffs were part of a broader trend of job cuts in tech firms and other industries, and followed Elon Musk's acquisition of the company and subsequent changes to its culture and operations.

1616533514358325265,"This tweet is misinformed. It claims that ""you do not need to bleed to have a period"" and that ""transgender women can absolutely have periods and need free hygiene products."" However, according to Medical News Today, trans women do not experience typical menstrual periods (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-trans-women-get-periods). They may experience physical and emotional symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but they do not have menstrual cycles or bleed.","This tweet is potentially misleading. A period, or menstrual cycle, is a biological process that involves the shedding of the uterine lining when an egg is not fertilized. It is not merely a state of mind. Ovulation, the release of a mature egg from an ovary, is a key part of this process. If the egg is not fertilized, it is expelled from the body during menstruation. Transgender women, while deserving of respect and inclusivity, do not have the biological capacity to menstruate or ovulate as they do not have ovaries or a uterus. Therefore, they cannot have periods in the biological sense. However, they may experience symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome due to hormone therapy.

According to multiple sources, including Politifact and BBC News, Rittenhouse traveled to Kenosha on his own, where he met up with a friend who had purchased a gun on his behalf. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Rittenhouse intended to harm anyone, with his attorneys claiming he was in Kenosha to protect businesses from looters and rioters. https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/15/viral-image/kyle-rittenhouses-mother-did-not-bring-him-kenosha/ https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59138213","This tweet is potentially misleading. The actor in question, Alec Baldwin, did not ""accidentally discharge a gun"" in the sense of carelessness. He was following the director's instructions during a scene rehearsal and was told the gun did not have live rounds. The union representing film workers has stated that it's not an actor's duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set. The tragedy was preventable, but not due to a failure of duty or a criminal act on the part of any performer.

There is no evidence to suggest that Nikki Haley or Ted Cruz don't use their given first names because of concerns about white supremacist voters. In fact, Ted Cruz has explained that he goes by Ted instead of Rafael because he was often teased as a child about his name rhyming with corn chip brands. Additionally, Cruz has used his full name, Rafael Edward Cruz, in official contexts, such as campaign contributions. The same goes for Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke, who has a nickname that is common in Mexican-American culture.https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2018/08/17/politifact-why-rafael-cruz-goes-by-ted-and-robert-orourke-by-beto/986885007// https://apnews.com/united-states-senate-senate-elections-73a9de92d9084b80adb53b12acfb9c65 https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=ted+cruz","This tweet is misleading. Ted Cruz's decision to go by ""Ted"" instead of ""Rafael"" was not politically motivated but rather a personal choice made during his junior high school years to avoid teasing related to his name rhyming with popular corn chip brands, as stated in his 2015 autobiography (https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2018/08/17/politifact-why-rafael-cruz-goes-by-ted-and-robert-orourke-by-beto/986885007/).
