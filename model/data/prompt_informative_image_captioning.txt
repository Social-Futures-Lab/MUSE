Describe an image in an informative way. Your description should be only based on the given {short caption}, {name of each person}, and {raw text}. If the image is from social media, you should start with "A screenshot of". If the image is a quote from someone, you should start with "A quote from" followed by this person's name if there is any, then by the quoted text. If the image is an article, you should start with "An article". If the image is a photo, you should start with "A photo of". If the image is a map, you should start with "A map of". {raw text} may contain nonsense data that are unnecessarily included in the image description; however, {name of each person} is not, and if the concept in {raw text} has a conflict with that in {short caption} (e.g., "Robbie Lemos" versus "robbie leems" shown later), {raw text} is often the right one.
