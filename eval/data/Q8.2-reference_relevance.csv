While it's true that parents should be vigilant about their children's Halloween candy, cases of tampered candy are rare and mostly urban legends.

However, the claim that all confiscated snacks are laced with THC may cause unnecessary panic. It's always good practice to check your child's candy, but also remember to keep medications and potential allergens away from children during this time.

The number of positions to be reduced represents only a quarter of the attrition the agency expects to see over a similar period. DeJoy has also stated that USPS will remain in a hiring posture in the coming years. As for why DeJoy still holds his position, the Postmaster General is not a political appointee and cannot be removed by a president. The power to remove the Postmaster General lies with the Postal Service's governing board, whose members were all appointed by President Trump.

While it's true that some states have restrictive abortion laws, it's not accurate to say a six-week pregnancy has more rights than women in the listed states. Twenty states prohibit abortions after the fetus achieves viability, between 24 and 28 weeks. Forty-four states prohibit abortions after a specified duration, with exceptions for the health of the woman, fetal abnormalities, or cases of rape or incest. The limits range from six weeks in Texas to the third trimester in Virginia. Furthermore, the majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, and support for legal abortion declines as pregnancy progresses.

Forty-four states prohibit abortions after a specified duration, with exceptions for the health of the woman, fetal abnormalities, or cases of rape or incest.

Misinformation like this can cause unnecessary fear and confusion. Please refer to these sources for accurate information:

While President Biden does have the power to cancel some student debt through executive action, it's not as simple as the tweet suggests. The Higher Education Act gives the Education Secretary the power to compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired. But, it's a complex issue with potential legal challenges. Also, it's not solely Republican officials who have expressed concerns about this approach.

While it's true that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was sold at a high price and is being refilled at a lower price, this doesn't necessarily equate to a profit for taxpayers. The SPR is a government-owned reserve meant to provide a buffer against potential disruptions in oil supplies, not a profit-making entity. The money from the sale goes back into the government's general fund, not directly to taxpayers. Furthermore, the price of gas is influenced by a multitude of factors, not just the sale or purchase of oil from the SPR.
