It's likely a computer-generated image using planetarium software, recreating an event that happened eleven years ago. The Perseverance rover, which recently landed on Mars, has not captured such an image. The claims of such a photo being real have been debunked multiple times. For real photos from the Perseverance rover, you can visit NASA's website.
