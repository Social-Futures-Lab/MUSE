While it's true that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was sold at a high price and is being refilled at a lower price, this doesn't necessarily equate to a profit for taxpayers. The SPR is a government-owned reserve meant to provide a buffer against potential disruptions in oil supplies, not a profit-making entity. The money from the sale goes back into the government's general fund, not directly to taxpayers. Furthermore, the price of gas is influenced by a multitude of factors, not just the sale or purchase of oil from the SPR.

It's important to note that Twitter, like any other online platform, can experience temporary issues due to various factors. Furthermore, despite concerns about Twitter's profitability and the departure of many engineers, the company has stated that its overall audience continues to grow.

Furthermore, advertisers have been leaving Twitter since Musk announced his intentions to buy the company, not just due to activist pressure.

Biden's statement about creating 700,000 manufacturing jobs is numerically correct, but it doesn't account for other factors like the pandemic relief bills that began under Trump and contributed to the rise in manufacturing jobs. Also, the recent job gains still leave manufacturing employment well below historical highs. Therefore, the fact-check isn't necessarily smearing negativity, but rather providing a more nuanced view of the situation.

After dropping mask requirements, airlines like EasyJet have experienced staff shortages due to increased COVID-19 cases. This has led to a significant increase in flight cancellations compared to pre-pandemic levels. The staff shortages are not solely due to COVID-19, but also due to a tight labor market and delays in security checks for new and returning staff. The situation serves as a crucial consideration for the U.S. as it contemplates lifting federal airline mask mandates.

The number of positions to be reduced represents only a quarter of the attrition the agency expects to see over a similar period. DeJoy has also stated that USPS will remain in a hiring posture in the coming years. As for why DeJoy still holds his position, the Postmaster General is not a political appointee and cannot be removed by a president. The power to remove the Postmaster General lies with the Postal Service's governing board, whose members were all appointed by President Trump.

Furthermore, the Democratic Party's stance on immigration is more nuanced than simply providing a ""sanctuary for illegals"". They advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country, but also stronger border security measures.

Furthermore, the number of unfilled job openings soared to nearly 11.9 million during Biden’s first 14 months in office, indicating a high demand for labor that was not entirely met.

Taxing the middle-class on thousands of everyday items from groceries to gas. And in the process – cutting taxes for the wealthiest. What in God’s name is that all about?,"This tweet is misleading. The House Republicans are not pushing for a 30% national sales tax. The FairTax plan, often associated with Republicans, does propose a 23% national sales tax, but it also includes provisions to protect lower and middle-income households from the burden of this tax. Furthermore, it's not accurate to say this plan would cut taxes for the wealthiest, as it aims to tax consumption rather than income.

A period, or menstrual cycle, is a biological process that involves the shedding of the uterine lining when an egg is not fertilized. It is not merely a state of mind. Ovulation, the release of a mature egg from an ovary, is a key part of this process. If the egg is not fertilized, it is expelled from the body during menstruation. Transgender women, while deserving of respect and inclusivity, do not have the biological capacity to menstruate or ovulate as they do not have ovaries or a uterus. Therefore, they cannot have periods in the biological sense. However, they may experience symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome due to hormone therapy.

It's true that the Biden-Harris administration's student debt relief plan is currently halted due to a lawsuit brought by six Republican-led states. These states argue that the plan exceeds the president's authority and could harm financial institutions if borrowers don't have to pay their outstanding balances. However, it's not just Republican officials and special interests involved in the lawsuit, but also federal courts that have deemed the program unlawful and issued an injunction. The Biden administration has appealed these decisions and asked the Supreme Court to review the matter.

However, attributing this solely to corporations using inflation as a cover to increase prices is an oversimplification. The increase in profits is also due to factors such as increased demand and undersupplied markets, as seen in the oil industry [2]. Furthermore, while some sectors, like the meat industry, lack competition [3], it's not universally true for all sectors. Therefore, the tweet could be misleading by implying that all corporations are price gouging due to inflation and lack of competition.

For instance, his first quarter salary in 2017 was donated to the National Park Service, and in 2018, it was given to the Department of Veterans Affairs, among others.

The U.S. is unique among modern constitutional democracies in allowing justices to serve for decades without term or age limits. This has led to some presidents appointing no justices and others appointing a significant portion of the Court. The Supreme Court TERM Act proposes 18-year term limits for justices, which would create a regular appointment process and ensure each president the opportunity to nominate two justices per four-year term. This could make the Court more representative of the nation and restore a constitutional balance to the three branches of the federal government. A majority of Americans are in favor of term limits. However, it's important to note that Khanna's bill would only apply to justices approved after its passage, and current justices would be exempt from the term limits.

Furthermore, even the most recent treatments fail to completely eliminate the tumor, which often relapses and becomes more malignant.

While it's true that the economy is growing and Americans are working, the claim that incomes are rising faster than inflation is not entirely accurate. Real wages, when adjusted for inflation, have barely changed over the past few decades. In fact, wage growth has mostly benefited the highest-paid workers, not the middle class. Furthermore, the income gap has been widening since the 1970s, with the top 1% of households seeing a much larger increase in their income compared to the middle 60% and the bottom fifth. These facts suggest that the middle class and unions may not be as strong as the tweet implies.

While it's true that Paul Whelan, a Marine veteran, remains detained in Russia, it's not accurate to say he was ""left behind enemy lines"" by Biden. Whelan was detained in Russia since 2018, before Biden's presidency. The Biden administration has been actively working to secure his release, as evidenced by the negotiations for a prisoner swap involving Whelan. The term ""stranded"" also implies abandonment, which is not the case here. The U.S. government has classified Whelan as wrongfully detained and has been making efforts for his release.

While it's true that the U.S. did finish 2021 with 6.6 million more jobs than it started with, the claim of creating more jobs than any administration at this point in a presidency is not entirely accurate when considering percentage increase, which is a fairer way to compare data over 80-plus years. In this regard, 2021 did not set a record and was exceeded 10 times since 1940. Furthermore, the pandemic relief bills and the numerical rise in manufacturing jobs began under Trump's administration. Therefore, attributing all the job gains solely to the current administration might be misleading. However, Biden does deserve some credit for the manufacturing job gains.

However, the claim that this is ""more than any Administration in history at this point in a presidency"" is misleading. The job growth is largely due to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a significant job loss before Biden took office. As for the 750,000 manufacturing jobs, the data shows an increase of about 600,000, not 750,000.

While fentanyl is indeed a potent drug, the risk of secondary exposure leading to opioid toxicity is extremely low, according to the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. It would take 200 minutes of breathing fentanyl at the highest airborne concentrations to yield a therapeutic dose, not a potentially fatal one. Furthermore, many reported incidents of fentanyl exposure among police share symptoms of a panic attack rather than an opioid overdose. Unnecessary precautions may waste time in effective overdose response and perpetuate stigma against drug users. For routine handling of the drug, nitrile gloves and, in exceptional circumstances, an N95 respirator provide sufficient protection.

The administration initially dismissed inflation as ""transitory"" before attributing it to external factors.

Musk's gains in net worth come mainly from his massive stakes in SpaceX and Tesla, and under the current federal tax code, he doesn't need to pay any tax until those assets are sold, or capital gains are realized. The tweet's call for a wealth tax aligns with the argument that progressive taxation is necessary to address wealth inequality. However, it's important to note that tax policy changes should encourage economic growth and opportunity, as suggested by the Tax Foundation.

The proposal is estimated to raise around $2.9 trillion, which would partially cover the $3.5 trillion legislation, with the rest expected to be made up from long-term economic growth (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-seek-corporate-wealthy-tax-hikes-for-3-5-trillion-plan). Furthermore, the final cost of the bill is still under negotiation, with some suggesting it may need to be reduced to $1-1.5 trillion to gain necessary support (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-seek-corporate-wealthy-tax-hikes-for-3-5-trillion-plan).",muse,Y

While it's true that the Build Back Better Agenda is intended to be funded by tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, saying it costs ""$0"" is not accurate. The plan is estimated to cost around $3.5 trillion over 10 years. The assertion that it won't raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year is also debatable, as some economists argue indirect costs could impact lower income brackets.
