While it's true that transgender women can experience symptoms similar to a menstrual cycle, such as bloating, mood swings, and cramps, due to hormone replacement therapy, they do not have periods in the traditional sense. A period is the shedding of the uterine lining, which requires a uterus, something transgender women do not have. The need for hygiene products is also not applicable in the traditional sense. However, the sentiment of inclusivity and understanding is important.

The scientific consensus, as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is that human activities are significantly affecting Earth's climate. This is supported by numerous peer-reviewed studies and scientific organizations, such as the American Meteorological Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Furthermore, recent research in the field of ""extreme event attribution"" has provided evidence that human activity is increasing the risk of certain types of extreme weather, particularly those linked to heat. This includes the extreme cold temperatures displayed in the attached image, which can also be influenced by climate change. For more information, please refer to these sources:

The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found it is extremely likely that the majority of the increase in global average surface temperature between 1951 and 2010 was due to human activities. The 2018 National Climate Assessment also points to human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, as the dominant cause of global warming.

The creator, Ryan McCarty, stated that he started the grid in the middle and worked his way out, aiming to create a ""fun whirlpool shape"". This is a common design in crosswords due to the rules around rotational symmetry and black squares.

While it's true that the time period from 2015-2022 represents a small fraction of manmade CO2 contribution, it's incorrect to suggest that climate change is a hoax based on this short-term data.

The World Meteorological Organization confirms that the past decade was the hottest on record (https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record).

3418,436,3,group5_user2,6,"This tweet is misleading. While it's true that 2022 may not be the warmest year on record due to a rare triple-dip cooling La Niña, this doesn't reverse the long-term warming trend. The 10-year average for 2013-2022 is estimated to be 1.14°C above the pre-industrial baseline, compared to 1.09°C from 2011 to 2020. The last eight years have been unusually warm, exceeding 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The long-term warming since the industrial revolution is attributable to increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Looking at data over a short period in isolation can lead to misleading conclusions. The impacts of climate change, such as record ocean heat levels and rising sea levels, are becoming more dramatic.
