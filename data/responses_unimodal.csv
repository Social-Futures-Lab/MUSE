This suggests that the number of employees is higher than the 1,300 stated in the tweet. The layoffs were part of a broader trend of job cuts in tech firms and other industries, and followed Elon Musk's acquisition of the company and subsequent changes to its culture and operations.

A period, or menstrual cycle, is a biological process that involves the shedding of the uterine lining when an egg is not fertilized. It is not merely a state of mind. Ovulation, the release of a mature egg from an ovary, is a key part of this process. If the egg is not fertilized, it is expelled from the body during menstruation. Transgender women, while deserving of respect and inclusivity, do not have the biological capacity to menstruate or ovulate as they do not have ovaries or a uterus. Therefore, they cannot have periods in the biological sense. However, they may experience symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome due to hormone therapy.

While fentanyl is indeed a potent drug, the risk of secondary exposure leading to opioid toxicity is extremely low, according to the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. It would take 200 minutes of breathing fentanyl at the highest airborne concentrations to yield a therapeutic dose, not a potentially fatal one. Furthermore, many reported incidents of fentanyl exposure among police share symptoms of a panic attack rather than an opioid overdose. Unnecessary precautions may waste time in effective overdose response and perpetuate stigma against drug users. For routine handling of the drug, nitrile gloves and, in exceptional circumstances, an N95 respirator provide sufficient protection.
